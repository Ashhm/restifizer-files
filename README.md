Restifizer
==========

Restifizer - it's a way to significantly simplify creation of full-functional RESTful services, using MongoDB as a database.

The key feature of the module - it's very coupled to mongoose (MongoDB module) 
as result it allows to make prototyping of the services as soon as it's possible. 
Almost all the features of mongoose becomes available in your server out of the box.
There is a list of some of these features:
 * querying engine - it literally means you can define MongoDB queries in your http-requests,
 * aggregation - you can use rich aggregation abilities of MongoDB in your http-requests,
 * nested objects and arrays - since resources are just MongoDB docs, you can easily use any nested structures supported,
 * data population - you can easily define what the additional data should fetched and populated (JOIN) in your resource.

> Such features on one hand allow your service to be developed extremely fast, but on other hand you always should remember, 
you need to solve all possible performance imapacts before comming production. 
For example you sould allow filtering by indexed fields only. By default it's allowed for each ones.     

*Restifizer* supports 2 kinds of data: 
  * resources - when client pass text data and get json back,
  * files - when uploading/downloading of files. 

## Resources

It's a core of RESTful services. Resources are available at a specific path on the server. For example: "/api/users".

## Supported HTTP methods

In the best traditions of REST-genre the most of the actions with resource can be "expresed" with http-methods. 
Restifizer supports following methods:
    * GET - selects a set of resources or a resource if a key is specified (see `select`, `selectOne`),
    * POST - saves new instance of resource on the server (see `insert`),
    * PUT - replaces existing instance of resource with data provided in request (see `update`),
    * PATCH - updates fields of existing instance of resource with values provided in request (see `partialUpdate`).
    * DELETE - removes existing instance of resource from the server (see 'delete'). 

### select

> I use `httpie` (https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) as a command line tool to test the servers. You can use any, but all the examples were created with syntax of `httpie`. Anyway it's recognizable.

Example:

```
http GET 'localhost:3000/api/users?filter={"username": "test"}&fields=username,createdAt&orderBy={"username": -1}'
```

It allows to get the list of resources according provided criteria. If no criteria provided, it return the first page
of `maxPageSize` with all available fields. 

#### Supported params

##### filter

It's json value containing any valid mongo db query. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-query for details. 
Example: 
{"sex": "M", age: { $gt: 18 } }}

###### regexp values

You can use regex values in filter. As we pass JSON in this param it's not possible to use regular expression objects (/pattern/).
You should replace it with `$regex` operator. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/ for details.

##### fields

Comma separated list of field names.

##### orderBy

It's json value built according MongoDB rules. Use 1 for an ascending sorting, and -1 for a descending sorting
Example:
{"username": 1, "age": -1}

See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#cursor.sort for details.

##### per_page

The maximum number of records in the response. `defaultPerPage` is used by default, and maximum is limited with `maxPerPage`.

See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.limit/#cursor.limit for details.

##### page

A number of page to return, `1` if a value is not provided. We skip `(page - 1) * per_page` records in the query to achieve that. 
See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/#cursor.skip for details.

##### q

Parameter for q-searches. It can be any string value. 
`restifizer` will use it to build the following condition for every value in your `qFields`:
```
{$regex: '.*' + q + ".*", $options: 'i'}
```

Example:
```
http GET 'localhost:3000/api/users?q=John'
```

See q-search section for details.

### selectOne

```
http GET 'localhost:3000/api/users/<id>'
```

It allows to get resource by `id` provided as the last part of URL. 

### insert

```
http POST 'localhost:3000/api/users' username=test password=pass
```

It allows to add new resources to the server. You can provide field values in body with json, or as form params. 


### update

```
http PUT 'localhost:3000/api/users/<id>' username=test password=pass
```

It completely replaces resource with provided `id` with new one specifided in the request. You can provide field values in body with json, or as form params. 
Be careful if no value for a field provided, it will be set to undefined. 

### partialUpdate

```
http PATCH 'localhost:3000/api/users/<id>' password=pass
```

It partially update resource with provided `id` with data from the request. You can provide field values in body with json, or as form params. 


### delete

```
http DELETE 'localhost:3000/api/users/<id>'
```

It removes the record by `id`.

## Aggregation

As an extension to standard rest-kit restifizer supports some built-in MongoDB aggregations.

### count

```
http GET 'localhost:3000/api/users/count?filter={age: { $gt: 18 } }}'
```

It allows do get count of records of specified resource. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.count/ for details.

#### Supported params

##### filter

It's json value containing any valid mongo db query. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-query for details. 
Example: 
{"sex": "M", age: { $gt: 18 } }}

### aggregate

```
http GET 'localhost:3000/api/users/aggregate?filter={age: { $gt: 18 } }}'
```

It performs aggregation of the resource records. See http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/aggregation/ for details.

TBD

## Response status

* 200 OK - after any successful request except POST.
* 201 Created - after successful POST.
* 404 Not Found - related resource has not been found for GET (by id), PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
* 400 Bad Request - request params cannot be parsed, or validation failed, or unique checking failed.
* 409 Conflict - mongoose VersionError happened.

## Paging

It relates to getting the list of resources. Every such response is limited with paging rules:
 # an user specifies `per_page` and `page` params in URL,
 # if params are not provided default rules are applied (see `restifizerOptions.defaultPerPage`),
 # if `per_page` greater then `restifizerOptions.maxPerPage`, value of `maxPerPage` is used. 

## Controllers

Controllers are the way to provide needed configuration for your resource and to customize its behaviour.
 
### Properties

#### ModelClass

Any resource is bound to mongoose model, and this param is a way to specify, what the model your resource uses.

#### path

With this option you specify the paths, where resource will be available at. There are 2 important points:
   * it can be a string, or an array if resource is available at several paths,
   * you can provide params in paths, and they will be automatically bound to params of requests.

For instance, you can write:
```
path: ['/api/appData', '/api/users/:owner/appData']
```
and in the case if an user requests data at `/api/users/543d2605e21f85d73b060979/appData`, appData will be filtered by 
provided value of `owner`.

#### fields

By default all the fields you defined in your model schema (without fields with name starting from "__") are available in your resource.
Providing this params are you able exclude some fields from the resource, or add new calculated fields.

#### idField

Name of id field. By default: '_id'. This value is used in route params for selectOne, update, partialUpdate, delete.

#### defaultFilter

With this param you can specify default `filter` value for your controller.

#### orderBy

With this param you can specify default `orderBy` value for your controller.
For example:
`orderBy: {date: -1}`

#### q-search

Q-search allows to search data without specifying exact fields of search. Just specify in your controller searchable fields:
 
```
qFields: ["login", "firstName", "lastName"]
```

and set `q` param of your GET request (see `q` for details).

### arrayMethods

Supported methods with arrays. Default value: ['$addToSet', '$pop', '$push', '$pull'].
It's relevant to partialUpdate (PATCH) only. You can specify such methods in order to manipulate array fields of your resourse.

The params and implemenations of these methods relate to the same methods in MongoDB:
* `$addToSet` - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/addToSet/#up._S_addToSet,
* `$pop` - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/pop/#up._S_pop,
* `$push` - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/push/#up._S_push,
* `$pull` - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/pull/#up._S_pull.


### Options

#### Option inheritence

You are able to customize the behaviour of your controllers very much. And we did all our best to make this process as simple as it's posible.
That's why you're able to specify option in one of the methods, and `restifizer` will apply inheritence rules to the options of other methods.
  
There are following rules:
```
defaultOptions ->
    selectOptions ->
        selectOneOptions
    insertOptions ->
        updateOptions ->
            partialUpdateOptions
            deleteOptions
    countOptions
    aggregateOptions
    
```

For example if you want to define `pre` processor for insert, update, partialUpdate, delete that's enough to define it in your `insertOptions`: 
```
var YourController = Restifizer.Controller.extend({
  ...
  insertOptions: {
    pre: function (req, res, next) {
      ...
    }
  }
```

### Handlers

#### pre

`pre: function (req, res, callback)`

`pre` is a preprocessor that is executed at the begining before any other logic runs. It's a good point to check
preconditions of your request. For example check if the request is executed by Admin:
```
      pre: function (req, res, callback) {
        // not admin
        if (!this.isAdmin(req)) {
          return callback(HTTP_STATUSES.FORBIDDEN.createError());
        }
        callback();
      }
```

#### collectionPost

`collectionPost: function (collection, req, res, callback)`

When `select` or `aggregate` return any collection from db, this collection is passed through this postprocessor.
It's a good point if you want to manipulate with the set of items of the collection, but not with items by themselves.

#### post

`post: function (resource, req, res, callback)`

`post` is postprocessor. It runs immediately before a resource is sent to an user.
At this point you can change the resource by itself. For instance, you can fill calculated fields here:
```
  defaultOptions: function (resource, req, res, callback) {
    if (resource.icon) {
      resource.icon_url =
        req.protocol + "://" + req.get('host') + '/api/resource/' + resource._id + '/icon';
    }
    callback(null, resource);
  }
```

#### queryPipe

`queryPipe: function (query, req, res, callback)`

You can use `queryPipe` if you need to call additional methods at `mongoose` `query` (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html).
This method is called after all `restifizer` calls are done, but immediately before `exec`.

Draw your attention, this method is called in 2 different semantics:
* in selects - in this case we expect you call `callback`,
* in IUD-methods - in this case we expect you directly return `query`.
In order to make your method workable in both semantics use the way from example bellow (return and call `callback` at the same line).

So, in this example we put `populate` to our query pipe:
```
    queryPipe: function (query, req, res, callback) {
      return query.populate("fieldToPopulate", callback);
    }
```

#### prepareData

`prepareData: function (req, res, callback)`

Prepares data to instantinate new document.
It's a point you can specify defaults for your resource when `restifizer` creates it. `Callback` reseives 2 params:
 * err - error, or null if there is no error happened,
 * data - object containg default values of resource fields.

If you do not specify the handler, `restifizer` uses `{}` to init the object.


#### beforeAssignFields

`beforeAssignFields: function (dest, source, req, callback)`

If it's defined, it runs immediately before `assignFields`, and has the same params.
You can use it to define what the params will be set.

#### beforeSave

`beforeSave: function (doc, req, res, callback)`

Handler, called when you create new resource or change existing instance of your resource after all assignments are already done, but immediately before saving it to your database

#### afterSave

`afterSave: function (doc, req, res, callback)`

If it's defined, it runs immediately after `saveDocument`, and has the same params.

#### afterChange

`afterChange: function (doc, req, res, callback)`

Very similar to `afterSave`, it calls immediately after it in inserts and updates, but it runs after deletes as well.
It can be a good point to integrate your kinf of `triggerEngine`. For instance, you can define something like that in
a base controller class of your application:
```
  afterChange: function (doc, req, res, callback) {
    redisClient.publish(this.ModelClass.modelName + '.' + doc.id, req.restifizer.action);
    return callback(null, doc);
  }
```
After that you will be able to subscribe to those events and handle them in flexible and scalable way.

#### beforeDelete

`beforeDelete: function (doc, req, callback)`

If it's defined, it runs immediately before removing the document.

#### beforeArrayMethod

`beforeArrayMethod(dest, methodBody, methodName, fieldName, req)`

If it's defined, it runs immediately before proceeding of array methods.

### Methods

#### getContext

`getContext: function (req)`

Returns context of the current request. Context os a place, when you can save any your variable with request's lifecycle.

#### assignFields

`assignFields: function (dest, source, req, callback)`

Assigns all fields from `source` to `dest` according `modelFieldNames`.
You can fetch any additional data at this point, or completely change the way fields are assigned.

Default implemenation iterates through all the fields, passing them through `assignFilter`, and calling `assignField`. 

#### assignField

`assignField: function (dest, source, fieldName, req, callback)`

Assigns single field with name `fieldName` from `source` to `dest`.
At this point you have enough data to deny assigning of exact values to exact fields for instance:
```
var YourController = Restifizer.Controller.extend({
  assignField: function (dest, source, fieldName, req, callback) {
    if (fieldName == 'status' && source[fieldName] == STATUSES.RESTRICTED_STATUS) {
        return callback(HTTP_STATUSES.FORBIDDEN.createError("It's not allowable to set restricted status"));
    }
    YourController.__super__.assignField.apply(this, arguments); // do not forget to call supper method
  },
});
```

#### assignFilter

`assignFilter: function (dest, source, fieldName, req)`

Filters assigning field with name `fieldName`.
In this method you can synchroniously return `true` / `false`, allowing / denying to assign exact feilds.
For example you can silently skip of changing of exact fields for non-admin users:
```
var YourController = Restifizer.Controller.extend({
  assignFilter: function (dest, source, fieldName, req) {
    if (fieldName == 'adminOnlyField') {
      return this.isAdmin(req);
    }
    YourController.__super__.assignField.apply(this, arguments);
  },
});
```

#### createDocument

`createDocument: function (data, req, res, callback)`

Creates mongoose document. It's called when you create new instance of your resource after all assignments are already done,
but immediately before saving it to your database.

#### saveDocument

`saveDocument: function (doc, req, res, callback)`

Saves document to db, called in inserts and updates, after `createDocument` or `updateDocument`.

### restifizerOptions

`restifizerOptions` allows you to define common options for all the controllers of your app.

#### defaultPerPage

This value is used in all `select` requests if no `per_page` has been provided. Default value is `25`.

#### maxPerPage

This value restricts maximum value of `per_page` supported with your app. Default value is `100`.
